An action that bumps a Homebrew formula after a new release.

Minimal usage example:

```yml
on:
  push:
    tags: 'v*'

jobs:
  homebrew:
    name: Bump Homebrew formula
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: mislav/bump-homebrew-formula-action@v1
        with:
          # A PR will be sent to github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core to update this formula:
          formula-name: my_formula
        env:
          COMMITTER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COMMITTER_TOKEN }}
```

The `COMMITTER_TOKEN` secret is required because this action will want to write
to an external repository. You can [generate a new PAT
here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and give it `public_repo` (or `repo`
if the homebrew tap repository is private) scopes.

Comprehensive usage example:

```yml
on:
  push:
    tags: 'v*'

jobs:
  homebrew:
    name: Bump Homebrew formula
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: mislav/bump-homebrew-formula-action@v1
        if: "!contains(github.ref, '-')" # skip prereleases
        with:
          formula-name: my_formula
          homebrew-tap: Homebrew/homebrew-core
          base-branch: master
          download-url: https://example.com/foo/v0.1.tar.gz
          commit-message: {{formulaName}} {{version}}
        env:
          COMMITTER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COMMITTER_TOKEN }}
          # GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

You should enable `GITHUB_TOKEN` only if the repository that runs this Action is
private _and_ if `COMMITTER_TOKEN` has the `public_repo` scope only.
`GITHUB_TOKEN` will be used for verifying the SHA256 sum of the downloadable
archive for this release.

Example of manually triggered workflow:

```yml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Formula version'

jobs:
  homebrew:
    name: Bump Homebrew formula
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: mislav/bump-homebrew-formula-action@v1
        with:
          formula-name: my_formula
          formula-version: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
          download-url: https://example.com/foo/v${{ github.event.inputs.version }}.tar.gz
          commit-message: {{formulaName}} {{version}}
        env:
          COMMITTER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COMMITTER_TOKEN }}
```

Explicitly setting `formula-version` requires `download-url` that is not a Git repository URL.

## How it works

Given a Homebrew formula `Formula/my_formula.rb` in the
[homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) repo:

```rb
class MyFormula < Formula
  url "https://github.com/me/myproject/archive/v1.2.3.tar.gz"
  sha256 "<OLDSHA>"
  # ...
end
```

After we push a `v2.0.0` git tag to a project that has this action configured,
the formula will be updated to:

```rb
class MyFormula < Formula
  url "https://github.com/me/myproject/archive/v2.0.0.tar.gz"
  sha256 "<NEWSHA>"
  # ...
end
```

This action will update the following formula fields if they exist:

- `version`
- `url`
- `sha256` - for non-git `download-url`
- `tag` - for git-based `download-url`
- `revision` - for git-based `download-url`

If you need to customize the value of `url` to something other than the standard
tarball URL, you can pass in the `download-url` input to this action.

To customize the git commit message used for updating the formula, you can pass
a template or regular string in the `commit-message` input to this action. The following fields marked up with `{{...}}` will be expanded:

| Field         | Description                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `formulaName` | the name of the formula supplied in `formula-name` |
| `version`     | the version number for this release                |

If the current `COMMITTER_TOKEN` doesn't have push access to the repo specified
by the `homebrew-tap` input, the formula will be edited in a fork that is
automatically created, and a pull request will be opened.

If the token has push access, but the default branch of the tap repo is
protected, a pull request will be opened from a new branch in the same repo.

Otherwise, the formula will be edited via a direct push to the default branch.
